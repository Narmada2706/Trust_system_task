        <h2>About Lavani</h2>
        <p  data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="200">
          Lavani is a combination of song and dance that is most commonly
          associated with the state of Maharashtra as well as the surrounding
          areas in the Konkan or Coastal Region. The word ‘Lavani’ is derived
          from the word Lavanya, which means ‘beauty’. Lavani aims to take
          various aspects of social life such as politics, religion, romance,
          etc. and present them in an entertaining form. It is performed by
          women who dance to the beats of a Dholak, which is an Indian drum. It
          isn’t uncommon for the Dholak to be accompanied by other instruments
          like a cymbal called the Manjeera, a string instrument called a
          Tuntuni, a Daf which is quite similar to a tambourine but has a single
          leather surface, along with a harmonium.
          <br />
          <br />
          Initially, Lavani was performed by shepherds and dhangars of the
          Solapur district of Maharashtra. The dance was performed to entertain
          soldiers going to war or away from their homeland. During the rule of
          the Peshawari Dynasty, Lavani was the most popular dance form. It was
          performed on stage and in the private chambers of royal members. There
          are Lavani songs that talk about the birth of dhangara and the
          shepherds’ deity. These songs connect Lavani with religious
          connotations.

          <br />
          <br />
          Dholki is the main instrument played during a Lavani performance.
          Dancers need to dance with the rapid beating of the dholki as they
          perform. With time Lavani has seen some changes, now it is performed
          on recorded music and live music that uses various instruments
          <br />
          <br />
          The costume that female dancers wear is called Nauvari because it’s
          nine yards long. The saree is longer but more comfortable than regular
          sarees. Women dancers also wear heavy jewelry such as bangles,
          Kamar-band, anklets, earrings, etc. They tie up their hair instead of
          in a bun called ambada in Marathi.

        <h2>About Dhangarigaja</h2>

        <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" >
          As the Dhangars of Sholapur district of Maharashtra herd to green
          pastures for grazing for their cattle, they become acquainted with the
          nature. Inspired by the scenic beauty, they compose poetry, called ovi
          writing about the nature and their God Biruba. They honour God Biruba
          once in every year when they return home. They spend their time with
          their families and beloved ones. And this is the time when the
          Dhangari Gaja dance is performed to please their God for His
          blessings. Dhangar dance is performed in traditional Marathi dresses -
          dhoti, angarakha and pheta with colourful handkerchiefs. Generally,
          during they dance, they move around a group of drum players.
          <br />
          <br />This art form is common among the shepherd community of Sholapur
          district. The cowherds, buffalo keepers, weavers, and sheep and goat
          keepers have to stay away from their families for a long time because
          of the nature of their occupation. During work, they spend most of
          their time close to nature. Being in the beautiful surroundings of
          nature and drawing inspiration from its grandeur, they write poems in
          the form of couplets. Their poetry is called ovi which along with
          representing their love for nature also unfolds their dedication
          towards God Biruba. When these shepherds return home, they celebrate
          their time with family and loved ones performing Dhangari Gaja dance
          on the beats of drums accompanied with the recitation of their poems.
          Through this dance, they also ask for blessings from their God.
          <br /><br />
          This traditional form of dancing is performed by men. Dancers wear
          Dhoti, Pheta, bright handkerchiefs and Angarakha during their
          performance. Attired in Marathi dresses, these men or more
          specifically, the shepherds recite poems (which tell fantastic stories
          about nature or their God and other things) and dance to the musical
          tunes of drums.
          <br /><br />The main theme of Dhangari Gaja dance performance is
          celebration, happiness, joy of coming home to loved ones and honoring
          the God and seeking his blessings. And this mood is emphasized by
          swaying to the pulsating sound of the drums and the singing of poems.
          All men form a group and dance around the drum players on the rhythmic
          tunes, exhibiting boundless enthusiasm.

        <h2>About Lezim</h2>

        <p  data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="200">
          Lezim dance is a folk dance of Maharashtra. It is also spelled as
          lazium or lezium. The dance was used to perform in the villages of
          Maharastra and Gujarat. Two different states added their own tradition
          and culture to it. Lezim is mainly performed during the Ganesh
          festival in Maharastra. In some places, Lezim is known as Ganpathi
          Dance.Lezim dance originated in 1986 during the rule of Chhatrapati
          Shivaji. It used to be a sport played by men for fitness. Some people
          in the community started presenting it as a dance performance. Lezim
          is also a musical instrument that is used in almost all dancer
          performances. With time it got limited to only Ganpathi processions.
          <br /><br />Earlier, there were a few variations of the Lezim
          practiced in the villages of Maharashtra; however these are hardly
          ever used today. In Lezim dance, there are various types of movements
          like stepping, hopping, squatting and bending. Every movement of the
          dance is executed in perfect time with the proper strikes which is
          swung in four or eight counts. This provides a rhythmic accompaniment
          to the dance. The Lezim dances and their specific gestures, movements
          have been adapted by the physical culturists in their exercises in the
          drive for beautiful body. The rural form of the dance usually consists
          of Lezim dancers in two rows, repeating a sequence of steps, changing
          the steps every few beats. Thus, a 5-minute Lezim performance consist
          of 25 different steps danced in harmony. Other variations include
          dancing the Lezim in four rows, in a single circle formation, or in
          concentric circles formations (similar to the Garba Dance), with each
          dancer twirling and dancers of opposite rows often playing Lezim with
          each other. Changes in steps are ‘announced’ by a ring leader using a
          whistle. <br /><br />
          Dholki, a drum instrument is used to accompany this dance form. Apart
          from the Lezim and Drum, it includes Halagi and Cymbals as musical
          instruments during the dance performance. The dancers wear colourful
          costumes. Lezim is frequently used as a fitness drill by schools,
          militias and other institutions.

        <h2>About Koli</h2>

        <p  data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="200">
          Koli is the dance form of Koli fisher folk of Maharashtra. The
          community has its own distinct identity and lively dances. The dance
          incorporates elements that this community is most familiar with - sea
          and fishing. The dance is performed by both men and women divided into
          two groups, where fishermen stand in two rows holding oars in their
          hands. The dancers move in unison, portraying the movement of the
          rowing of a boat. Fisherwomen are in the opposite rows with their arms
          linked and advancing towards men folk. The separate formation then
          break up and they dance together with movements symbolizing the waves,
          the breakers and rowing from cliff to cliff and casting of nets to
          catch the fish.
          <br /><br />Both men and women participate in the Koli dance
          performance. Since the Koli community is attached to the sea and fish,
          the Koli dance performance is very close to nature. The dance
          movements are connected with rows and nets that are used in their
          occupation. The entire dance is the portrayal of their daily activity
          which is the part of their work. The movements of the men and women
          are about the way they work and the act of catching the fish along
          with the movement of the waves. Men hold the stick and women jump
          along with the movement of the stick. Everyone enjoys this dance a
          lot, making it the most important folk dance of Maharashtra.
          <br /><br />
          The costumes that they wear are unique, sometimes women wear green
          color sarees and men wear lungis. This dance mainly shows their
          hardships of catching the fish which is the only source of their
          livelihood. The dancers of this community form the union and dance
          together. It is a way of celebrating their work and they cherish this
          day as the onset of the fresh new season of harvesting just like
          farmers. The sea and boats are sacred to them and are worshipped by
          them regularly. The dancers show every part of their livelihood
          through this dance.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bolder">Gondhal</h2>
    <br />
    <div class="wrapper">

        <br />
        <h2>About Gondhal</h2>

        <p  data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="200">
          Gondhal is a Marathi folk theatre in the form of worship that is
          performed exclusively by a group of men as part of rituals after
          ceremonies like marriage or a new birth. The literal meaning of the
          word ‘Gondhal’ is ‘commotion’ which is the dramatic narration of
          mythical stories, praise of heroes or narration of folk legends. All
          these forms part of a ritual dedicated to different divinities.
          Gondhal is an educative, entertaining and important tradition. It is
          one of those few important folk arts of Maharashtra that has become an
          inseparable part of the lifestyle of the people.
          <br /><br />
          The tradition of Gondhal originates from the homage paid to the Mother
          Goddess by Parashuram. Once Parashuram killed a demon named ‘Betasur’,
          cut off his head, sowed his arteries and veins through the crown of
          his head and made a musical instrument out of it. Making a sound from
          that instrument, he went toward Goddess Renuka and worshipped her.
          <br /><br />
          ‘Gondhal’ is performed as a remedy to the suffering caused by age old
          spiritual defects in the premises and also to terminate distress
          caused by negative energies, continuing for generations. In order to
          reduce the suffering of other family members, caused by negative
          energies, the Goddessis awakened with a loud sound and is invoked to
          undertake Her mission of destruction.
          <br /><br />
          Gondhal takes place in front of the Yajamana’s i.e. host’s house. A
          wooden board on the ground is covered with a new cloth, on which rice
          or jowar grains are arranged in a square, in each corner a half
          coconut, betel nuts, dry dates, turmeric roots, a banana and betel
          leaves are placed. A pitcher filled with water, betel or mango leaves
          and whole coconuts are placed at the centre, near the idol of the
          Goddess. The Goddess is worshipped with flowers. Five stalks of jowar
          plants or sugar-cane sticks at each corner of the board have their
          heads tied together in a bunch above the pitcher. A string of thin
          wafer-like kadakanya i.e. sweet Puri and karanjya i.e. coconut pie,
          with a garland hanging over the pitcher are tied to the top,
          signifying the Goddess’s presence.
          <br /><br />
          The chief Gondhali is dressed in a huge, knee-length garment requiring
          around 25 m of cloth, and wears a string of 64 cowrie shells and 64
          silk gondas i.e. tassels set alternately and a kanganidar pagri i.e.
          tall turban. His companions wear traditional everyday dhotis.
